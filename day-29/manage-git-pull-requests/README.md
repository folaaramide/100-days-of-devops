# Day 29: Git Branch Protection and Pull Request Workflow
In this exercise, we focused on implementing a safe Git workflow where no one can push directly to the master branch. This is a common industry best practice to ensure code quality, auditability, and stability in production environments.

## Project Overview
### Business Need:

Direct pushes to master are risky because master represents the final, production-ready code. Any unreviewed change could break builds or production services.

### Goal of the Exercise:
‚Ä¢	Ensure all code changes are first made in feature or story branches.

‚Ä¢	Submit Pull Requests (PRs) for review before merging into master.

‚Ä¢	Assign reviewers to enforce a peer-review workflow.

#### Outcome:
Max‚Äôs story ‚ÄúThe ü¶ä Fox and Grapes üçá‚Äù was successfully merged into master only after review and approval by Tom, demonstrating a safe and collaborative workflow.

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1. SSH into the Storage Server

ssh max@ststor01

# Password: Max_pass123

‚Ä¢	Navigate to Max‚Äôs home directory where the repository is cloned.

‚Ä¢	Verify repository structure and existing branches.

git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all

git branch -a

‚Ä¢	Confirm Max‚Äôs branch story/fox-and-grapes exists.

‚Ä¢	Validate commit history, author info, and previous stories (e.g., Sarah‚Äôs stories).
